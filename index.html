        <h3>
            Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
        </h3>
        <ul reversed>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa.</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> 
                thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br> Administration".</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps,
                 helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>them", he said. 
                 "All of this left scars on me.".</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong>Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>cuts. 
                Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding 
                pest-resisten plants.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>rejected. 
                Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br> DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, 
                and other applied science.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupong, Leaves behind his <br>
                pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
                Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of desease <br>resisten wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1945 </strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>yields.</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong>
                - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on <br>
                to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong>
                - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the indian subcontinent <br>in time to help mitigate
                 mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong>
                - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum <br>yields.</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong>- Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University.</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - States "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>
                Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br> 
                demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently <br>
                dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for <br>
                a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best <br>
                breeds.".

        </ul>
